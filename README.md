# FlemsBox
FlemsBox is a projets based on Flems. It follows the philosophy of Flems.io to provide a simple html/css/js online editor that one can configure through the url. The original goal was to have an html/css/js tutorial editor for edutional purposes. Why create another one when there are so many online editors like code.pen and the likes ?

I needed a serverless solution without adds... I was about to develop a small app myself and I stumbled on Flems that offered more than I could need. Flems.io on the other hand is just the "online editor" and I can't push anything else than code for flems.

That's where I started to code this "specialized" application that keeps the #hash to push content not only in le flems app but also in the <body></body> content.

This is a work in progress based on my limited knowledge (I'm not a developer) and these results were achieved with the help of chatbots.
