# FlemsBox
FlemsBox is a projets based on Flems. It follows the philosophy of Flems.io to provide a simple html/css/js online editor that one can configure through the url. The original goal was to have an html/css/js tutorial editor for educational purposes.

WThen why create "yet another one" wysiwyg editor when there are so many online editors like code.pen and the likes ?

I needed a serverless solution without adds... I was about to develop a small app myself and I stumbled on Flems that offered more than I could dream of. Flems.io - an online version based on flems - just offers the "online editor" but I needed to embed my editor into context driven activities for the learner.

That's where I started to code this "specialized" application that keeps the useful #hash to push content not only in le flems app itself but also other content in a page that contain content and an editor !

This is a work in progress based on my limited dev knowledge (I'm not a developer - i'm a teacher) and these results were achieved with the help of chatbots.
